      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout my career and personal life, I have worked on various projects that have challenged me and allowed me to grow as a person. Some of my most significant projects include a student portal, where I had the opportunity to develop a solution that provides a hub for almost every need at the university. 
      </p>  
      <p>
        Currently, I am working on a portal for recruitment, which is a place where you can submit job applications and get new opportunities. The portal covers the whole process of recruiting such as attracting candidates, selecting candidates, and offering the job.  I am excited about this project because it has the potential to attract qualified people to work at the university.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Mexico, where I spent most of my childhood exploring the outdoors and reading books. I have always been fascinated by walking and hiking, and I pursued my dreams by studying for a bachelorâ€™s degree in Applied Technology at BYU-Idaho.
After graduating, I began my career in the higher education industry, where I have worked for ten years.
      </p>
      <p>Throughout my career, I have gained valuable experience in several programming languages, which has helped me to become a respected professional in my field.
In my free time, I enjoy traveling and reading history books, which have allowed me to develop a well-rounded perspective on life. I believe that pursuing one's passions is essential for personal growth and fulfillment, and I encourage everyone to find their own unique interests and pursue them.
